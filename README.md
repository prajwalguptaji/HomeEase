### Key Features:
- Customers can request services from their chosen professional.
- Professionals can either accept or reject service requests.
- After service completion, customers can mark the request as closed and provide feedback.
- Admins have full control to create services, manage customer/professional profiles, and more.
- The application is extendable and scalable to integrate additional secure features.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Flask**: Core framework for routing, request handling, and template rendering.
- **PyJWT**: For creating and verifying JWT tokens for secure authentication and user session management.
- **WTForms**: Prevents CSRF attacks by incorporating CSRF tokens.
- **Requests**: Simplifies API interaction for data sending and receiving.
- **Flask_SQLAlchemy**: Provides seamless integration with databases.
- **Flasgger**: For generating and displaying API documentation via Swagger UI.

### Frontend:
- **HTML, CSS, JS**: Core technologies used for building the frontend of the application.
- **Bootstrap 4**: For responsive design with pre-styled components and a flexible grid system.
- **Chart.js**: For creating interactive, customizable data visualizations.

### Others:
- **Flask_CORS**: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **Flask_Migrate**: For handling database migrations.
- *and more...*

## Database Schema

The application uses a structured database with 9 main models:
1. **User**: Represents a system user (Admin, Professional, Customer).
2. **Professional**: Represents a professional offering services.
3. **Customer**: Represents a customer linked to a User.
4. **Category**: Represents service categories (e.g., Electrical, Appliance Repair).
5. **Service**: Represents specific services offered.
6. **ServiceRequest**: Represents a customer's request for a service.
7. **Review**: Stores customer feedback for services or professionals.
8. **Notification**: Stores user notifications.
9. **Contact**: Stores contact form submissions.

## API Design & Endpoints

This project includes **53 API routes**, each designed to handle specific functionality. Swagger UI is integrated using the **Flasgger** module for easy API documentation and testing. All API endpoints require **JWT Bearer key** authentication for secure access.

### Some of the Key API Routes:
- **User Authentication**
- **Service Request Management**
- **Professional Profile Management**
- **Review Submission**
- **Admin Management (Create/Edit Services)**

### Authorization:
- Proper authorization is required for accessing features based on user roles (Admin, Customer, Professional).
- JWT-based authentication ensures that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Other dependencies mentioned in `requirements.txt`

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mynkpdr/mad1project.git
cd mad1project
 ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the application:
```bash
flask run
```

### Sample Data:
To populate the database with sample data for testing, you can use the createdb.py script. This script will insert some sample users, services, and other data into the database.

Note*: You need to make sure API is running because it uses API calls to send POST requests.

Run the following command to populate the database:
```bash
python createdb.py
```
The script will automatically add the following sample data:

- An admin user with full access
- A set of categories.
- A set of services.
- A set of professionals.
- A set of customers.
- A set of contacts.
- A set of service requests.
- A set of notification to admin, professionals and customers.
- A set of reviews

You can modify the createdb.py script to add more sample data as needed.
